The [Game of Life][wikipedia:life] is a [cellular automaton][wikipedia:cellular-automaton] that had a lot of interesting properties.

The universe of the Game of Life consists of a square grid of _cells_. Each cell can be in one of two states; either _dead_ or _alive_. Each step in time the next state of a cell depends on the state of its eight neighbors:

1. Any live cell with two or three neighbours survives and stays alive
2. Any dead cell with exactly three neighbours become alive
3. All other cells don't change state
