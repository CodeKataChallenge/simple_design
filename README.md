# Understanding the four rules of simple design
In the book [_Understanding the four rules of simple design_][book:4rules] [Corey Haines][twitter:coreyhaines] shares his insight after seeing thousands of people work on a specific code kata exploring the four rules of simple design.

Originally formulated by [Kent Beck][twitter:kentbeck] the four rules of simple design are

1. Tests Pass
2. Express Intent
3. No Duplication
4. Small

Superficially shallow, these four rules contain a wealth of insight. It can take a lifetime to master these concepts and apply them into software design.

One way of achieving mastery of a subject is through [Deliberate Practice][wikipedia:practice]. That is why Corey Haines explores the nuances of the four simple rules through the medium of _Code Kata's_
